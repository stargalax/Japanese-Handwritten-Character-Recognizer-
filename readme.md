## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads one or more images of handwritten/printed Japanese characters.
2. Images are read using OpenCV and displayed inline.
3. EasyOCR processes each image to extract readable Japanese text.
4. The recognized characters (with confidence scores) are printed for each image.

## 🔧 Potential Improvements

| Area                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Handwriting Support** | EasyOCR works best with clean, large handwriting. |
| **Custom Models**       | For better accuracy, use ETL8G or Kuzushiji-trained CNNs. |
| **Drawing Input**       | Add a canvas or sketch pad to draw directly in Colab. |
| **App UI**              | Convert to a web app using **Gradio** or **Streamlit**. |
| **GPU Support**         | Enable GPU in Colab for faster inference. |
